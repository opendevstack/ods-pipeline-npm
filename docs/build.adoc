= ods-pipeline-npm-build

Builds Go applications.

The exact build recipe can be found at
link:https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-pipeline-npm/blob/main/build/images/scripts/build.sh[build/images/scripts/build.sh].

The following provides an overview of the performed steps:

- Source files are checked to be formatted with `gofmt`.
- The go module cache is configured to be on the cache location of the PVC by setting environment variable `GOMODCACHE` to `.ods-cache/deps/gomod` (see link:https://go.dev/ref/mod#module-cache[go module cache]).
- `golanci-lint` is run. The linter can be configured via a
  config file as described in the
  link:https://golangci-lint.run/usage/configuration/[configuration documentation].
- Tests are executed. A potential `vendor` directory is excluded. Test
  results are converted into xUnit format.
- Application binary (named `app`) is built and placed into the directory
  specified by `output-dir`.

The following artifacts are generated by the build task and placed into `.ods/artifacts/`

* `code-coverage/`
  ** `coverage.out`
* `lint-reports/`
  ** `report.txt`
* `xunit-reports/`
  ** `report.xml`

Instead of the built-in script, one can also specify a build script located
in the Git repository using the `build-script` task parameter. This allows
full control of building and testing, including any generation of artifacts.
Note that some other task parameters have no effect when a custom build
script is used, unless they are handled properly in the script. At a
minimum, the custom script should place its outputs in the directory
identified by `output-dir`.


== Parameters

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
| Parameter | Default | Description

| working-dir
| .
| Working directory. The path must be relative to the root of the repository,
without leading `./` and trailing `/`.



| enable-cgo
| false
| Whether to enable CGO. When not enabled the build will set `CGO_ENABLED=0`.


| go-os
| linux
| `GOOS` variable (the execution operating system such as `linux`, `windows`).


| go-arch
| amd64
| `GOARCH` variable (the execution architecture such as `arm`, `amd64`).


| output-dir
| docker
| Path to the directory into which the resulting Go binary should be copied, relative to `working-dir`. This directory may then later be used as Docker context for example.


| cache-build
| true
| If enabled tasks uses or populates cache with the output dir contents (and artifacts) so that a build can be skipped if the `working-dir` contents did not change. You must set this to `"false"` if the build can be affected by files outside `working-dir`. See ADR caching-build-tasks for more details and workarounds.


| build-script
| /usr/local/bin/go-build
| Build script to execute. The link:https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-pipeline-npm/blob/main/build/images/scripts/go-build.sh[default script] is located in the container image. If you specify a relative path instead, it will be resolved from the workspace. See the task definition for details how the build script is invoked.


| pre-test-script
| 
| Script to execute before running tests, relative to the working directory.

== Results

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Name | Description

| build-reused-from-location
| The cache location that the build task used. If caching is not enabled this will be an empty string.
