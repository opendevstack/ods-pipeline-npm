Builds Node.js applications using npm.

The built-in script executes the following steps:

- check that package.json and package-lock.json exist to require best practice of using lock files. See also link:https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-pipeline/discussions/411[discussion 411]
- linting using `npm run lint`
- build application, using `npm run build`
- test execution, using `npm run test`

For linting to work there needs to be a `lint` task in the `package.json` file,
for example `npx eslint src --format compact`, together with a config file
(`eslintrc.json` or similar) at the root of the working directory. This can
be done by running `eslint --init` or by following the
link:https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started[official documentation].

The exact build recipe can be found at
link:https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-pipeline-npm/blob/main/build/images/scripts/build.sh[build/images/scripts/build.sh].
In particular, `npm run build` is expected to place outputs into `dist` and
`npm run test` is expected to create `build/test-results/test/report.xml`
and `build/coverage/{clover.xml,coverage-final.json,lcov.info}`.

An example configuration for the test script is:

```
JEST_JUNIT_OUTPUT_DIR='build/test-results/test' JEST_JUNIT_OUTPUT_NAME='report.xml' npx jest --reporters=default --reporters=jest-junit --coverage --coverageDirectory=build/coverage --forceExit ./dist
```

The following artifacts are generated by the build task and placed into `.ods/artifacts/`

* `code-coverage/`
  ** `clover.xml`
  ** `coverage-final.json`
  ** `lcov.info`
* `lint-reports`
  ** `report.txt`
* `xunit-reports/`
  ** `report.xml`

Instead of the built-in script, one can also specify a build script located
in the Git repository using the `build-script` task parameter. This allows
full control of building and testing, including any generation of artifacts.
Note that some other task parameters have no effect when a custom build
script is used, unless they are handled properly in the script. At a
minimum, the custom script should place its outputs in the directory
identified by `output-dir`.
